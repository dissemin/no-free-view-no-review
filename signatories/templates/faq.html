<h2>FAQ about the pledge</h2>
<h3>What is an "open access" venue?</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access">open access</a>
publishing model aims at making the output of research publicly available on the
Internet. To qualify as open access, a venue must make its research articles
freely available, without subscription fees, under a permissive license such as <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons">Creative Commons</a>,
without requiring the payment of extortionate article processing charges. For a
more detailed definition of open access, see the
 <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Declaration_on_Open_Access_to_Knowledge_in_the_Sciences_and_Humanities">Berlin
  declaration</a>. You can also watch the <a
  href="https://phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1533">introductory video</a> from
PhD comics.</p>

<h3>Why does open access matter?</h3>

<p>The current subscription-only publication model is problematic for several
reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A significant amount of public money is spent to pay subscription prices
    to private actors with high profit margins (e.g., Elsevier had a 37%
    operating profit margin in 2018), even though these actors have no
    involvement in the research they publish. What is more, there is no
    competition on this market: publishers possess the journals, the
    irreplaceable research that they contain, and the prestige attached to their
  name.</li>
  <li>Some universities cannot afford the high subscription prices and cannot give
    their researchers access to the articles. This is especially problematic in
    developing countries.</li>
  <li>Non-academics cannot access articles. This includes researchers in
    companies, teachers and students outside universities (e.g., high-school),
    hobbyists, policymakers, patients and their families (for medical research),
    etc.</li>
  <li>General members of the public cannot have access to research, which is an
    ethical problem when this research was paid for by public money (the
    main way to fund academia in many countries).</li>
  <li>Even for researchers in subscribed institutions, it is difficult to access
    articles outside of campus, e.g., at home.</li>
  <li>The contents of scientific articles cannot easily be indexed by search
    engines, making them invisible outside academia.</li>
  <li>Closed-access works are harder to access, so they receive <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_impact#Open_Access_publications">less
      citations</a> than open-access works.</li>
</ul>

<h3>If I decline to review for a journal, will it prevent me from publishing
  there?</h3>
<p>Almost all venues that we know about do not carry a formal requirement that
authors to the venue will perform reviews for the venue. However, some communities
feel an obligation of reciprocity, where by submitting to a venue, you take a
moral commitment to help run the venue by performing reviews of your own.</p>

<p>This moral commitment is often <a
  href="https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/122201/does-the-peer-review-reciprocity-principle-apply-globally-or-per-venue">unclear</a>,
and it is debatable. For many authors, it is a difficult move to refuse to
submit research at some venues, because research can be a collaboration
with authors not sharing the same principles, or with authors at an early stage
of their career who need to publish quickly. However, the choice of where to
review is individual, so it can be a more effective mechanism to help steer a
community towards a healthier publishing model. In the end, how you feel about
this is a personal matter that depends on your community and preferences.</p>

<p>Of course, if you are uncomfortable declining review requests from venues where you have
published or intend to continue publishing, you are always free to make
exceptions, in particular providing reviews in compensation for the reviews that
you receive.</p>

<p>More generally, as with any kind of political stand, you may find that some of
your colleagues disagree with your opinions, and in unhealthy communities they
could make your life harder. If you are worried about this, please only take the
pledge if you are at a stage of your career when you can afford it.</p>

<h3>When refusing a review, can I advertise the pledge?</h3>

<p>It would be fantastic! We hope such a public pledge will make it easier
for the editor to understand your position, and make them think about the issue. :)</p>

<h3>There are no reputable open-access venues in my community, what can I
  do?</h3>
<p>If open-access venues are not frequent in your community yet, you can still
decline to review for closed-access venues, and help your community in different
ways. For instance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Posting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_peer_review">open
      reviews</a> of recent articles published on open repositories (e.g., <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArXiv">arXiv</a>).</li>
  <li>More generally, summarizing the research of your community in open-access
    media, e.g., reviews on arXiv, blog posts, Wikipedia articles, etc. This
    helps your community by making its research more broadly visible, and we
    would argue that it counts as community service if the research that you are
    showcasing isn't your own.</li>
  <li>If you are sufficiently senior, you could start a new open access
    journal in your area, or "flip" an existing journal, i.e., convince the
    editorial board to collectively resign and restart the journal as open
    access on a different platform. See <a
      href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/UC-OSC-Guide-to-Transitioning-Journals-to-OA.pdf">this
      guide by the university of California</a> or <a

  journal, check out <a href="https://scipost.org/">SciPost</a>,

<h3>How will boycotting reviews make a difference?</h3>
<p>It is true that unethical publishers will probably always be able to
find reviewers, especially the most prestigious ones. Nevertheless, we believe
that good peer review is a vital part of the scientific process, to provide
valuable and timely feedback to authors and publish good research. Hence,
reducing the pool of reviewers for closed-access venues can make them less
attractive and encourage authors to switch to open-access alternatives. What is
more, by declining to perform reviews for closed-access venues, we free up time
to work on more relevant venues, and diminish our involvement with outdated
models. This also gives us an opportunity to bring up the issue to the editorial
board of the reviewer, and start a conversation about publication models,
whereas boycotting closed-access journals by avoiding to submit articles to them
is less visible (but of course it is still worth doing).</p>

<h3>Can I take my name off the pledge?</h3>
<p>Simply <a href="{% url 'about' %}">contact us</a> and we will remove it.</p>

<h3>What is ORCID, should I use it?</h3>

<p><a href="https://orcid.org">ORCID</a> provides persistent
identifiers for researchers, which can be used to link them to their works,
grants and employers.</p>

<p>Signing the pledge with your ORCID account makes your signature more
trustworthy. It is also faster, as it bypasses email confirmation and captchas.</p>
